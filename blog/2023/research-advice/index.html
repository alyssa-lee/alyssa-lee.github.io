However, these postings are only a small subset of the possible opportunities. Therefore, here are some ways you can look for research labs:</p> <ul> <li>Go to the <a href="https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/voting-faculty.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comp bio department website</a> and read about faculty research. Keep in mind that the information there may be outdated. <ul> <li>Once you’ve identified some professors, visit their lab websites (<a href="https://www.pfenninglab.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here is an example</a>). These are probably out of date too, but you can get a general sense of what problems they are working on.</li> <li>Email the professor(s), summarize who you are and what you’ve done (like classes), and ask if they have space for undergrads in their lab. If they say yes, meet with them (preferably in person) to decide if joining the lab would be right for you.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Ask professors who’ve taught your courses if they can recommend research labs that might be a good fit for you. Or ask to work in their lab. This is a great idea if there’s a professor you like/trust, since they’ll know about the personalities and research interests of your potential mentors, and be able to steer you in the right direction.</li> </ul> <h2 id="am-i-ready-to-do-research">Am I ready to do research?</h2> <p>Sure! Here’s some advice:</p> <ul> <li>You do NOT need to know a lot about the specific research topic prior to joining the lab. You’ll learn as you go.</li> <li>That said, you should have an appropriate foundation of knowledge. What this means will vary by lab, but for comp bio research in general it’s good to be comfortable with programming and intro-level biology. It’s even better if you’ve taken 02-251: Great Ideas in Computational Biology (an overview of the field) or other comp bio courses. Ask the professor what skills you should have and which ones you can learn along the way.</li> <li>You do need to be willing to spend a significant amount of time learning new things (reading papers, meeting with your mentors, making mistakes). Research is a commitment. As you plan your workload for the semester, think of research like taking a class.</li> <li>Are you a first-year? It’s definitely possible for freshmen to start doing research in their first spring/summer, but many don’t until later. For some, it’s better to wait until you’ve taken more classes and had time to adjust to the college workload. Other people want to start right away. Think about what <em>you</em> need and decide accordingly.</li> <li>Professors understand that you are an undergrad and don’t have much experience yet. They are not expecting you to already be familiar with their field. They are looking for someone who wants to learn, and is willing to put in the work to do it.</li> </ul> <h2 id="what-to-consider-before-joining-a-lab">What to consider before joining a lab</h2> <p>Let’s say you’re looking at a professor’s lab website and deciding if you should join. You should consider the following:</p> <ul> <li>Are you interested in the research topic? Pick something that sounds interesting to you. It’s okay if you don’t know a lot about it. Honestly, the research topic matters less at this stage than what you will learn from the experience.</li> <li>Read some papers they’ve published recently. You can search the professor’s name on Google Scholar. Since lab websites are often not updated regularly, skimming recent papers is the best way to get a sense of what they’re working on. You don’t have to understand everything. When you meet the PI, tell them you’ve read the papers and ask them to explain anything you were confused about.</li> <li> <strong>Very important:</strong> Talk to the PI (principal investigator, meaning the professor who’s in charge of the lab), but don’t <em>just</em> talk to the PI. Also talk to other members of the lab, particularly the grad student who will be mentoring you, and see what the lab culture is like. Preferably, meet them in person. If there are any other undergrads who’ve worked in the lab, ask them what it was like. Do you think you’ll have a good mentor/mentee relationship with the PI and grad student(s)? Your mentors are responsible for setting you up for success and guiding you as you learn. Pick mentors with the time, energy, and inclination to make sure you are supported during your time there. Ideally, your mentor is someone you like, respect, and are comfortable asking “dumb” questions to. (The more questions, the better!)</li> <li>Ask if you can attend a lab meeting. Usually everyone in the lab meets once a week to give updates on their work and ask for advice. This is a great way to find out what they’re working on right now, and also get a sense of the lab culture.</li> </ul> <h2 id="course-credit-and-paid-opportunities">Course credit and paid opportunities</h2> <ul> <li>If you are doing research in the summer, there are grants you can apply for called SURA and SURF. SURA is for first- and second-year students, and you receive course credit for research without paying tuition. SURF has a more involved application process, and you get paid a stipend for doing research. Check the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer%20research%20fellowships/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Office website</a> for more information.</li> <li>For computational biology research during the school year, you can get course credit by enrolling in 02-500. If your research is in another department, you can also get course credit. Ask your advisor about it.</li> <li>There is also a <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/undergraduate/honors-research-thesis" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">senior thesis option</a>. This is typically done in two semesters during your senior year, often with a professor/lab you’ve already started doing research with.</li> <li>Some opportunities are paid if your lab has the funding, but this is not really expected.</li> </ul> <p>NOTE: There is a “one-semester research guarantee” for students who are <strong>primary majors</strong> in computational biology. In reality (as of 2023), the undergrad program is pretty small and students generally have no trouble finding research opportunities. The guarantee is unnecessary to be involved in research.</p> <h2 id="the-lane-cluster">The Lane cluster</h2> <p>This is a computing cluster used by the computational biology department. If you are doing heavily computational research, your PI (principal investigator) will have to get you an account so you can access this cluster. <a href="https://gitlab.com/mguler/lane_cluster" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Here is an invaluable guide for using it.</a></p> <p><a href="../../">back to blog</a></p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Alyssa Lu Lee.

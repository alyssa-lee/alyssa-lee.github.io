I'm so excited to be attending Rutgers University for my [Ph.D. in Quantitative Biomedicine](https://iqb.rutgers.edu/whyqb) this fall!

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with my [B.S. in Computational Biology](https://cbd.cmu.edu/education/undergraduate/bs-computational-biology/) in May 2024. Subsequently, I worked as a Bioinformatics Analyst at the University of Pittsburgh.

I spent my final semester as an undergrad at the [Williams-Mystic Coastal & Ocean Studies Program](https://mystic.williams.edu/), where I studied science, history, literature, and policy, conducted independent research, and visited a few different coastal regions! I wrote about my experiences on this blog.

At Carnegie Mellon, I was co-president of the undergraduate Computational Biology Society and played oboe in the All University Orchestra.

I love reading books and I share book recommendations on this blog frequently.

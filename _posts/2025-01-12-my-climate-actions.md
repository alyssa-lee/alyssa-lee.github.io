I recently wrote a post about [how I'm donating for the climate this year]({% post_url 2025-01-12-donations-for-climate %}). I also want to talk about changes I'm making in my own life to address the climate crisis.

First, I would like to remind everyone that the impact of your individual carbon footprint is negligible compared to the scale of the problem. That's why we should focus on systemic policy changes, like transitioning to clean energy on a nationwide scale. This [video by Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiw6_JakZFc) provides a good overview.

That means you shouldn't spend too much time feeling guilty about personal choices like driving gas-powered cars and buying products that aren't "green," especially if the more environmentally friendly option isn't realistic for you right now. I grew up in a neighborhood where cars were absolutely necessary; there was basically no such thing as public transit and many roads had no sidewalks or pedestrian crossings. If you're a homeowner, you could install an electric vehicle charging station in your garage, but if you're a renter, you wouldn't have consistent access to a charging station. The infrastructure for clean transportation simply isn't there yet in most places. I'd love to change that, but that will take time.

That said, I'm still taking steps to reduce my own carbon footprint. I believe in "doing what you can," even if it's small. I also find that changing my everyday habits inspires me to view climate action as an important part of my life. I think a lot about the book [*Atomic Habits*](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear, which says that your actions inform your identity, which then shapes your actions. You can take advantage of this self-reinforcing loop to change your habits.

> 2. Prove it to yourself with small wins."

I've started thinking of myself as a person who cares a lot about the climate. As an example, I've mostly stopped cooking meat at home, although I still eat it in restaurants or when other people cook. The reasons are several:
- Meat, especially beef, causes a lot of carbon emissions and environmental damage
- It's healthier to eat less meat and more vegetables
- Factory farming is pretty unethical
- Vegetarian and vegan people in my life have made it seem less scary to not eat meat 

That last point is pretty crucial. I've found that my view of what's "normal" or appropriate is largely shaped by the views of the people around me. In turn, I've realized that changing my behavior also has an effect on the people who know me. Maybe, after being around me, they'll spend a little more time thinking about the climate. That kind of ripple effect is powerful.

Beyond my everyday personal choices (less meat, less single-use plastics, taking the bus), I'm thinking about what I can do to advance the larger systemic changes that we really need. So far, it's starting small, like writing a letter to my elected officials. I could see myself getting involved more heavily in political advocacy, although as a pretty introverted person, the idea is daunting. I'm also thinking hard about my career path, and how I can use my skills as a computer scientist/biologist for the climate.

I'll continue to think and write about what I can do for the climate. I'm hopeful that I can do my part in bringing us toward a fossil fuel-free future.

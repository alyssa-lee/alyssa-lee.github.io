I've gotten into crochet lately, and I love it.

*Turquoise yarn is my work. Everything else is props*

You know what I had to do, then, when I found this [guide on how to crochet DNA with proper chirality](https://jpolka.blogspot.com/2014/02/how-to-crochet-dna-with-proper-chirality.html).

That was fun, but then I thought back to my molecular biology class (03-442 with John Woolford, probably my favorite class ever at college). For a project, we had to construct an artistic representation of translation initiation. Mine ended up being paper cutouts of enzymes and whatnot, but if I had known how to crochet then, it SO would've been a crochet model.

So here's my own design, based on the basic DNA structure given above, of semiconservative DNA replication:

If you look closely, you can see the RNA primers and Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. It's beautiful <3


Fun fact: Okazaki fragments were discovered by and are named for Reiji and Tsuneko Okazaki, a married couple of molecular biologists from Japan.

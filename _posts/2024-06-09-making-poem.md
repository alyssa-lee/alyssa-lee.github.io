Making
<br/>
by A.L. </p>

--

<p style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: 'Georgia', Times, serif">
The sea has as many true meanings
<br/>
as there are creatures in the sand. 
<br/>
Turn out its pockets
<br/>
and you'll find
<br/><br/>
a dead snail's shell made home by a hermit crab
<br/>
the flesh of a whale in the belly of a squid in the process of becoming whale again
<br/>
a lobster trap caught in the net of the sea
<br/><br/>
you, crouched over a tidepool,
<br/>
tucking shells in your pockets.
<br/>
Listening to the rush, rush
<br/>
of the sea making and unmaking and then making again-
<br/><br/>
Stealing sand from your shorelines
<br/>
and coaxing coves from your cliffs
<br/>
Slipping away with your belongings
<br/>
and bringing them back changed, new.

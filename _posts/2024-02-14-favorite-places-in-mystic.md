I love it here in Mystic, Connecticut. Here are some of my favorite places so far:

- **Mystic Aquarium**: I'm obsessed with this place. Best aquarium ever. They have friendly beluga whales. I got to pet a bunch of cownose rays. A cleaner shrimp tried to clean my hand. I stared at the jellyfish for... a really long time. I get in for free as a Williams-Mystic student. I am SO going back.
- **Mystic Seaport Museum**: My new home campus! I like walking around and looking at all the old ships and stuff. Also, they have really cool art exhibits, including *Oceanus* by Alexis Rockman (I wrote about it [here](../the-great-wave)). There's so many things I haven't even seen.
- **Olde Mistick Village**: A collection of little shops with... oddly specific themes? There's a spooky bookstore (they only sell spooky books), a flavored honey store (go in and taste ALL the honey), an Alice in Wonderland tea shop, and a bunch of other random little places.
- **Mystic downtown**: The non-Olde version. So many adorable gift shops. I walked with my friends to the library, and we probably spent two hours getting distracted by stuff on the way.
- **Sift Bake Shop**: Their pastries are works of art. Like, they literally have commemorative watercolors of the pastries hanging on the walls. The place is also really cute inside. Highly recommend.
- **The Mystic River estuary**: Does this count as a place? It's kind of the whole area. It's really pretty. Watch the sunset over it.


I also enjoy **The Ditty Bag** (sustainable goods and bulk store), the **Ocean Community YMCA**, and the **Mystic and Noank Library**. I like to study in the **Carlton Marine Science Center** and hang out with the shrimp in the lab. There are so many books just sitting in my house that I want to read, plus all my reading for class.

I'm excited to update this list as it gets warmer and I venture out more. (I did enjoy building snowmen on the museum campus yesterday after a snowstorm.) There are several more places I want to visit, including the non-spooky bookstore in town and Drawbridge Ice Cream at the drawbridge (I won a gift card during orientation). Right now, I'm enjoying my classes and home-cooked meals, and I have a feeling it's going to be a great semester.

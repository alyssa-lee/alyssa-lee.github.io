The way the author describes trees is so cute. You could fall in love with trees from reading this book (or at least, I did).

Some things to know about trees:
- Trees are very social! They can warn other trees of danger via scent, share nutrients, and send messages through massive underground fungal networks.
- A forest creates its own microclimate, adjusting the conditions to the trees' liking (often cooler and wetter than the surrounding environment).
- Trees use electrical impulses to transmit information and respond to signals, analagously to our own nervous systems. They can even learn from past experiences, though the mechanism isn't yet understood.

You should read this book if you like trees. Walking through a forest is vastly more interesting to me now because I'm imagining all the strange and wonderful things the trees might be up to. I like trees :)

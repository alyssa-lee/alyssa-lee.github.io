I'm back!

My ten days offshore were crazy and awesome and challenging. I've decided my experience is best explained through pictures. If you click on the pictures or go to [this link](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBdfBa), you'll get to see my descriptions/journal entries about each one.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/199935152@N07/albums/72177720314618047" title="Williams-Mystic: Offshore in the Caribbean"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53514307520_57d6ca237e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Williams-Mystic: Offshore in the Caribbean"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The photos are not organized chronologically. That lines up with the way the experience feels in my head, a collection of memories that bubble up in loosely related categories rather than on a timeline. Often there were so many activities packed into a single day that I couldn't tell one day from another. Also, keeping watch in the middle of the night, almost every night, did not help with the whole consistent-perception-of-time thing.

If you would like to check out the trip blog, with a post each day from one of my shipmates, go to the [Seamester blog](https://www.seamester.com/semesters/williams-mystic-custom-voyage-spring-2024/?trip-log-id=113545). Several of the photos I posted are from there; the rest are from my own camera.

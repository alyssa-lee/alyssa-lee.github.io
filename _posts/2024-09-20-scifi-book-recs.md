## The Illuminae Files (trilogy)
Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff

![illuminae book cover](../../../assets/img/2024-09-20/illuminae.jpg){: style="max-width:400px"}

[*Illuminae*](https://amiekaufman.com/books/the-illuminae-files/illuminae/) is absolutely epic. There are spaceships, explosions, zombies, a morally questionable AI, and of course, romance. I love all three books in the series. The best part is the way it's told-- through text messages, transcribed security-camera footage, classified documents, and more. I've definitely reread it at least ten times. The books are at least two inches thick and I can never put them down until I reach the end.

## This Is How You Lose the Time War
Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone

A love story, written as a series of letters between two agents on opposite sides of a war in time and space. I love the vaguely fantasy-sci-fi setting, which is imaginative and beautiful.

## Artemis
Andy Weir

[*Artemis*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/250305/artemis-by-andy-weir/) was written by Andy Weir, famous for *The Martian* (book, movie) and "The Egg" (mindblowing [short story](https://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html), [Kurzgesagt video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)). He's known for his obsessive attention to scientific detail in his fictional works.

*Artemis* is about Jazz Bashara, a smuggler living on humanity's first lunar colony. When she discovers a plot to take over Artemis, she plans a crazy heist using her criminal mind and scientific genius to save her home. 

I have to say I enjoyed this book more than *The Martian*, just because the action feels more fast-paced compared to the diary of one guy stranded alone on Mars. That said, I love Andy Weir's writing, and I look forward to reading more of his work.

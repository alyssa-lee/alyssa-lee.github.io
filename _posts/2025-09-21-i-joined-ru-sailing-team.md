I joined the Rutgers sailing team! After leaving Williams-Mystic, I wasn't sure if I'd get the chance to sail again. Lucky me, I ended up at a school with an awesome sailing team :) It's pretty laid back if you aren't competing, which is good for me as a beginner.

I've been to a few practices so far, and last time I got to skipper! (That means I'm sitting in the back steering the boat, as you can see in the photo.) In the smaller one-person boats I sailed at Williams-Mystic, I did skipper, but this felt pretty different. I felt really clumsy trying to switch sides on the boat while also steering and adjusting the sail. I was starting to get the hang of it by the end though :)

It's a lot less stressful to be crew, which is the role of the second person in the boat (responsible for the smaller sail-- the jib-- while also moving around to keep the boat from tilting too far to one side). It's still a challenge, though.

I'm excited to keep going to practice and improving my sailing skills. Thanks to the experienced team members and coaches for helping me learn. It's awesome!

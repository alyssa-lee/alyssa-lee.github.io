I went sailing solo today for the first time! It was a beautiful, sunny day with a gentle breeze, perfect for sailing. My instructors assured me that a person would have to try very, very hard to capsize in such pleasant conditions.

Guess who TOTALLY capsized her boat and fell in. The wind changed, the boat was spinning, I had no idea how to fix it, and suddenly everything tilted and I was floating in the water. It was cold. I clung to my capsized boat and kinda floated helplessly until I was rescued. Someone had to help me turn the boat back upright. I scooped some water out and went on my way.

I think I got the hang of it after that! I was able to sail back to the dock without any more mishaps. I’m excited to go out on the water again.

My class spent the last few weeks making a sail. A lot of time spent measuring, cutting, and trying to understand why the sewing machine wasn’t working. I thought it was pretty awesome. Although I didn’t try it myself, I got to see our sail out on the water today. It’s beautiful, with blue, yellow, and white colors.

Class ran an hour late because of the sailing mishaps, so I cooked a very fast and very delicious noodle stir fry, with shiitake mushrooms and some dried shrimp we got in Louisiana. We had to get to the next event, which was literature class at sunset.

We met on an old whaling ship docked at the museum to read the final pages of Moby Dick aloud. At one point I was lying on the deck and gazing up at the ship’s mast, surrounded by a half moon, scattered clouds, and a few stars. It was nice.

I love it here. I'm so sad that there's only four weeks left...

I'll have the memories forever.

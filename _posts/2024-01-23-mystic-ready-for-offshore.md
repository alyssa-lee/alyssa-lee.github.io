I'm (almost) ready for our offshore voyage! A fun fact I learned today was that the Williams-Mystic crew will be sailing on the *Argo* for the first time ever, which is a 112-foot-long sailboat WITH SHOWERS. Truly an unexpected luxury.

I'll have no internet access or cell reception, so don't expect to hear from me for the next week and a half. If you do want limited updates, though:
- You can track my vessel [here](https://www.seamester.com/vessel-tracker/). It'll be a small blue boat symbol in the Caribbean.
- There will be occasional posts to the [Williams-Mystic blog](https://williamsmystic.wordpress.com/). Maybe even some pictures from the boat!

My housemates are all here and we cooked dinner together. It was great.

I've packed my bags and am ready to leave at 2 in the morning. (That's in five hours.) I probably brought too many books, even though I removed a couple. I might not have time to read them all, though, because they will be keeping me busy as a member of the crew. I have no idea how to do any of this yet, but my duties will include hoisting the sails, keeping watch, cooking, dish duty, cleaning, and probably some others that I forgot.

I'm excited to:
- Get to know my classmates
- See wildlife and amazing views!
- Learn about the ocean and its history
- Finally feel warm air again
- Journal on the boat

I'm also kind of nervous. I packed a lot of seasickness medicine.

I should really go to sleep now. I'll be back in 10 days with plenty of stories. Bye for now!

Sea-Weed
<br/>
by D. H. Lawrence </p>

--

<p style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: 'Georgia', Times, serif">
Sea-weed sways and sways and swirls
<br/>
as if swaying were its form of stillness;
<br/>
and if it flushes against fierce rock
<br/>
it slips over it as shadows do, without hurting itself.

</p>

It is called “<strong>Zero-shot ecological annotation of microbial genomes with myLLannotator accelerates scientific discovery</strong>” by Alyssa Lu Lee, Arya Sharma, and <a href="https://maddamsetti.science/">Rohan Maddamsetti</a>, bioRxiv, 2026 (preprint). You can see it at <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.18.700140v1">bioRxiv</a>.</p> <p>I wrote a python package called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/myllannotator/">myLLannotator</a>, a user-friendly tool for automated annotation of metadata with open-source large language models.</p> <p>The idea came up quite naturally in a conversation with my professor, while we were discussing some of his previous work. As part of it, he had to go through a very large number of microbial samples from an online genome database and label each one based on where it came from (for example, “Humans”, “Animals”, or “Food”). Unfortunately, the metadata was often missing or inconsistent. For example, some samples would list the host as “Homo sapiens”, while others might leave it blank and write “human sputum” in an entirely different field. This is frustrating when you have to annotate thousands of samples. Then, if you wanted to add another category, like whether the microbial sample is a pathogen or not, you would have to go through and annotate thousands of samples <em>again</em>. Most researchers do not want to do this. They would prefer to spend their time thinking of cool new ideas.</p> <p>Fortunately, large language models are great at this type of task. We tried automating the same annotation task from his original paper, and it worked great! We wanted to create a tool that was fast, easy to use, and open-source to make LLM annotation more accessible to all kinds of researchers, even those without much coding experience or access to powerful computers. That’s why we built myLLannotator around a very small LLM, llama3.2-3B, which runs fairly fast on a laptop. (Although you can absolutely hook it up to more powerful LLMs if you want to!) Despite the model’s small size, it was able to replicate the paper’s results and even make a new discovery. We are excited to share myLLannotator with the research community, and we hope that it will help researchers analyze large public databases without having to label everything by hand.</p> <p>Our python package can be installed from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/myllannotator/">PyPI</a> and the source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/alyssa-lee/myLLannotator">Github repo</a> (open-source!). Programming enthusiasts are encouraged to poke around in the code and adapt it for their own needs.</p> <p><strong>Aside: thoughts on the research and writing process</strong>: This was relatively quick and simple as far as research papers go. (Some take years and years…) I definitely have ambitions to work on larger-scale projects and train fancy machine learning models of my own, but this is a win! It’s straightforward and concretely useful. This is also my first time writing a paper and navigating the publication process (with a lot of help from my professor, of course). I’m delighted to be doing science.</p> <p><a href="../../">back to blog</a></p> <p>     </p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="phd"/><category term="biology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA["Zero-shot ecological annotation of microbial genomes with myLLannotator accelerates scientific discovery" by Alyssa Lu Lee, Arya Sharma, and Rohan Maddamsetti, bioRxiv, 2026 (preprint). doi: https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.01.18.700140]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Photos from my trip to Santa Barbara!</title><link href="https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2026/santa-barbara-trip-photos/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Photos from my trip to Santa Barbara!"/><published>2026-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2026/santa-barbara-trip-photos</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2026/santa-barbara-trip-photos/"><![CDATA[<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-footer="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/199935152@N07/albums/72177720331520925" title="Santa Barbara jan 2026"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/55048827439_2256336675_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Santa Barbara jan 2026"/></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>Full bird list:</p> <ul> <li>Anna’s Hummingbird</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>White-crowned Sparrow</li> <li>Northern Mockingbird</li> <li>American Crow</li> <li> <p>Turkey Vulture</p> </li> <li>Mallard</li> <li>Ruddy Duck</li> <li>Double-crested Cormorant</li> <li>Great Egret</li> <li> <p>Snowy Egret</p> </li> <li>Seagulls (various)</li> <li>Brown Pelican</li> <li>Sanderling</li> <li>Long-billed Curlew</li> <li>Willet</li> </ul> <p>My favorite:</p> <p><img src="../../../assets/img/2026-01-18/sanderling.png" alt="sanderlings" style="max-width:400px"/></p> <p>Sanderlings are adorably tiny birds that nest in the Arctic and migrate south for the winter.

I just finished my first semester as a PhD student. For those who don’t know, the rough outline of my PhD program is as follows:</p> <p>Year 1:</p> <ul> <li>Do 3 rotations (2 months of research in each lab; after I finish all 3 rotations, I decide which one will be my <del>forever home</del> thesis advisor)</li> <li>Take classes</li> </ul> <p>Year 2:</p> <ul> <li>Do research in my thesis advisor’s lab</li> <li>Take classes</li> </ul> <p>Years 3-5+:</p> <ul> <li>Do research in my thesis advisor’s lab</li> <li>Propose, write, and eventually defend my PhD thesis</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>This semester, I did 2 out of 3 rotations and took classes. My classes were:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Biophysical Chem I</strong>: The 3D structure of proteins</li> <li><strong>Dynamical Models in Biology</strong>: Differential equations for modeling biological systems</li> <li><strong>Theory of Probability</strong>: Lots of mathematical proofs of important foundational ideas in probability theory (the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, among others)</li> </ul> <p>The classes were good, but the real star of my PhD is, of course, the research. I got to do research in two different labs this semester, which was awesome :)</p> <h2 id="my-first-two-rotations">My first two rotations</h2> <p>My first rotation was in the <a href="https://bhattacharyalab.com/">Bhattacharya lab</a>, which studies corals, seaweed, and extremophiles. My second rotation was in the <a href="https://sagardkharelab.org/">Khare lab</a>, which does protein engineering. They are both working on a project to develop enzymes that biodegrade seaweed. (For a fuller explanation on why this is important, see my post <a href="/blog/2025/why-study-seaweed-biofuel/">here</a>.)</p> <p>The seaweed project, briefly:</p> <ol> <li>Find enzymes in microbes that can degrade seaweed</li> <li>Engineer the enzymes to make them better at it</li> </ol> <p>I spent my first rotation on step 1 (identifying seaweed-eating enzymes by sequencing the seaweed microbiome) and my second rotation on step 2 (training a protein-designing AI model to make new proteins with higher salt tolerance). I wrote a lot of code and presented my work to the group at the end. I also met some excellent people and got to learn more about what they do :)</p> <p>The real purpose of the rotation is to choose a thesis advisor. I’m not going to spill my thoughts on that just yet, because I still have one more rotation to go! I will say that it’s going to be a tough decision. I may also end up being co-advised by two professors.</p> <h2 id="reflections-on-my-first-semester">Reflections on my first semester</h2> <p>Overall pretty good! I feel very lucky to be doing a PhD. (Life of the mind, etc etc.) I did burn out near the end, which was a mistake on my part. So, I’m going to relax and enjoy the winter break, and I’ll come back next semester excited and ready to do science again :)</p> <p><a href="../../">back to blog</a></p> <p>     </p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="phd"/><category term="biology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!

The piles of decomposing seaweed release toxic gases that are unsafe for humans, and they also kill marine life by blocking sunlight and depleting oxygen. The <a href="https://sabreproject.org/">SaBRe project</a> is trying to transform the masses of Sargassum into something useful for humanity by engineering enzymes to break it down into “biofuels, animal feeds, chemicals to replace petrochemicals, bioplastics, and pharmaceuticals” (<a href="https://nautil.us/new-life-for-rotting-seaweed-1238008/">great article about it from <em>Nautilus</em></a>).</p> <h2 id="is-turning-seaweed-into-fuel-going-to-solve-climate-change">Is turning seaweed into fuel going to solve climate change?</h2> <p>No. The only way to prevent catastrophic global warming is to stop burning fossil fuels. That is now a question of politics, not science. (Renewable energy is far cheaper than fossil fuels for electricity generation and has been for years. Source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth">Our World in Data</a>)</p> <h2 id="is-biofuel-even-a-good-idea">Is biofuel even a good idea?</h2> <p>It depends. Biofuel in the U.S. generally means growing corn to burn as gasoline, which is neither efficient nor carbon-neutral. (As put by <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/us-corn-biofuels">Hannah Ritchie</a>, “Putting food into cars is a poor use of land.”) While electrification is the clear winner for cars, there are some cases where electrification isn’t feasible, like long <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/aviation-part-two">plane flights</a>. In those cases, using biofuels is better than more fossil fuel extraction. If we do need biofuel, wouldn’t it be better if we didn’t have to use valuable food-growing land (i.e. the entire U.S. Midwest) to produce it? This is where the hypothetical seaweed refineries come in. (Note that the end product might <em>not</em> be biofuel: animal feed, pharmaceuticals, and bioplastics are also on the table.)</p> <h2 id="what-problems-will-it-solve">What problems <em>will</em> it solve?</h2> <p>Getting rid of the gross seaweed piles is an obvious benefit. Is there an economic case for using seaweed in manufacturing? Seaweed bioprocessing is still in the early stages of R&amp;D. We don’t know yet whether the economic benefits will outweigh the costs, because the technology required to convert seaweed into useful goods at scale hasn’t been invented. We’re hoping that the answer is yes.</p> <p><a href="../../">back to blog</a></p> <p>     </p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="phd"/><category term="biology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pros and cons of seaweed as fuel]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I joined the Rutgers sailing team!</title><link href="https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2025/i-joined-ru-sailing-team/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I joined the Rutgers sailing team!"/><published>2025-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2025/i-joined-ru-sailing-team</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2025/i-joined-ru-sailing-team/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="../../../assets/img/2025-09-21/boat.jpg" alt="internalimg" style="max-width:400px"/></p> <p>I joined the Rutgers sailing team! After leaving Williams-Mystic, I wasn’t sure if I’d get the chance to sail again. Lucky me, I ended up at a school with an awesome sailing team :) It’s pretty laid back if you aren’t competing, which is good for me as a beginner.</p> <p>I’ve been to a few practices so far, and last time I got to skipper! (That means I’m sitting in the back steering the boat, as you can see in the photo.) In the smaller one-person boats I sailed at Williams-Mystic, I did skipper, but this felt pretty different. I felt really clumsy trying to switch sides on the boat while also steering and adjusting the sail. I was starting to get the hang of it by the end though :)</p> <p>It’s a lot less stressful to be crew, which is the role of the second person in the boat (responsible for the smaller sail– the jib– while also moving around to keep the boat from tilting too far to one side). It’s still a challenge, though.</p> <p>I’m excited to keep going to practice and improving my sailing skills. Thanks to the experienced team members and coaches for helping me learn. It’s awesome!</p> <p><a href="../../">back to blog</a></p> <p>     </p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">science book dump!</title><link href="https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2025/science-book-dump/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="science book dump!"/><published>2025-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2025/science-book-dump</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alyssa-lee.github.io/blog/2025/science-book-dump/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="../../../assets/img/2025-09-21/everything-is-tuberculosis.jpg" alt="everything is tuberculosis book cover" style="max-width:250px"/> <img src="../../../assets/img/2025-09-21/crossings.jpg" alt="crossings book cover" style="max-width:250px"/> <img src="../../../assets/img/2025-09-21/blight.jpg" alt="blight book cover" style="max-width:250px"/></p> <h2 id="everything-is-tuberculosis-by-john-green"><em>Everything is Tuberculosis</em> by John Green</h2> <p>I am a huge fan of John Green as a novelist, as a science YouTuber, and as an activist. This book is a history of tuberculosis, humanity’s most deadly infectious disease for millennia, and how it has shaped human society. John Green writes with compassion, clarity, and optimism about why tuberculosis (a disease we know how to cure!) is still the leading cause of death by infectious disease today, and how we can choose to change that. He also partnered with my favorite science YouTube channel Kurzgesagt to make a <a href="https://youtu.be/GFLb5h2O2Ww?si=Gi_IMJEWrT23lrqL">video</a> about it.</p> <p>The scientific hurdles to eradicating tuberculosis are largely solved. What will rid us of tuberculosis is access to quality care for people everywhere in the world. This is not a problem for science to solve, but for society. As Albert Einstein wrote in 1949, “Science, however, cannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends.” That’s why I believe my responsibility as a scientist extends beyond creating knowledge. I also have a responsibility to ensure that scientific knowledge is used to benefit all people. John Green is the kind of person I aspire to be: a scientist-activist focused on making the world a better place.</p> <h2 id="crossings-how-road-ecology-is-shaping-the-future-of-our-planet-by-ben-goldfarb"><em>Crossings: How Road Ecology is Shaping the Future of Our Planet</em> by Ben Goldfarb</h2> <p><em>Crossings</em> was an entertaining and fascinating read!

The rally was part of a nationwide protest against the Trump administration’s science funding cuts. The <a href="https://standupforscience2025.org/our-policy-goals/">major policy goals</a> were to end censorship of science, secure federal science funding, and protect diversity and inclusion programs. It got <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/stand-science-rally-thousands-federal-plaza-chicago-oppose-trump-administration-research-funding-cuts/15989395/">local</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-doctors-cuts-budget-trump-health-climate-cead2742a686b3dbc2fe4b1294939454">national</a> news coverage!</p> <p><img src="../../../assets/img/2025-03-07/stand-up-for-science-protest.png" alt="Photo of crowd at stand up for science protest" style="max-width:350px"/> <img src="../../../assets/img/2025-03-07/stand-up-for-science-sign.png" alt="Photo of handmade sign saying stand up for science" style="max-width:350px"/></p> <p>I was really excited to go and brought my own sign! It was my second protest ever. (My first one was the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/climate-rally-in-oakland/">“Climate Can’t Wait” rally</a> in Pittsburgh <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/environment-energy/2025-02-08/pittsburgh-climate-rally-urge-local-action">last month</a>.)</p> <p>As a young scientist, I’m pretty uncertain about my career prospects right now. Even if the NIH funding cuts are reversed or a new administration restores science funding in four years, plenty of damage has already been done. It may take some time for scientific agencies and institutions to recover.</p> <p>I’m proud to be able to stand up for scientific research– not just for me, but for everyone who relies on vaccines, medicines, clean water, and all the other innumerable good things that come from federal science funding. Other than attending protests, spreading the word, and calling elected officials, I’ll keep following my own dream of being a scientist and hope that better times are to come.</p> <p><a href="../../">back to blog</a></p> <p>     </p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="climate"/><category term="biology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I attended the Stand Up for Science protest in Chicago!

Each one argues that a particular idea, like “the habitable zone” or “people are sheep”, should be discarded. Some of them directly contradict each other. My favorite essays take down common misconceptions about statistics, where many scientists (including myself) frequently encounter pitfalls.</p> <h3 id="the-song-of-the-cell">The Song of the Cell</h3> <p>by Siddhartha Mukherjee</p> <p>The history of cell biology, from the discovery of cells to today’s medical breakthroughs, narrated by talented writer/physician/researcher Siddhartha Mukherjee. I really like this one. Mukherjee tells anecdotes from his own life to complement the main story, which are often amusing, moving, or both.</p> <h3 id="project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</h3> <p>by Andy Weir</p> <p>I’ve written <a href="/blog/2024/scifi-book-recs/">before</a> about how much I enjoy Andy Weir, and this book was unexpectedly heartwarming. As always, the story is full of fascinating (sometimes fictional) scientific details. Also, it’s about aliens. Would recommend :)</p> <h3 id="the-light-eaters-how-the-unseen-world-of-plant-intelligence-offers-a-new-understanding-of-life-on-earth">The Light Eaters: How the Unseen World of Plant Intelligence Offers a New Understanding of Life on Earth</h3> <p>by Zoe Schlanger</p> <p>This book is beautiful! I love the way the author sees plants, as growing (haha) evidence indicates that plants are capable of making decisions, making sense of complex information, and other behaviors that resemble what we might call intelligence. One chapter that stuck with me was about a plant that can mimic the visual appearance of nearby leaves from <em>any</em> other plant, even ones that aren’t native to its area! How does it know what they look like??? Does it have <em>eyes</em>? Is it lifting genetic information from its neighbors’ bacteria? We don’t know (yet).</p> <h3 id="revenge-of-the-tipping-point">Revenge of the Tipping Point</h3> <p>by Malcolm Gladwell</p> <p>This book is about epidemics, whether viral (like COVID-19) or sociobehavioral (like bank robberies), and the factors that precipitate them. I have to remind myself to approach popular sociology books with a healthy dose of skepticism (it’s too easy to see what you want to see when diagnosing society’s ills). That said, <em>Revenge of the Tipping Point</em> is a thought-provoking and engaging read. Would recommend.</p> <p><a href="../../">back to blog</a></p> <p>     </p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="books"/><category term="biology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andy Weir, Siddhartha Mukherjee, Malcolm Gladwell, and more]]></summary></entry></feed>
